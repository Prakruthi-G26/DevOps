Swap sugary drinks for water, add more fruits and vegetables to your meals, and choose lean protein sources. Consider consulting a registered dietitian for personalized dietary guidance.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Incorporate gentle exercise:**  Even small amounts of physical activity can make a big difference. Begin with short walks a few times a week, gradually increasing the duration and intensity.  Find an activity you enjoy to make it sustainable.  Even 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week can significantly reduce your risk for the conditions mentioned.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Manage stress:**  Chronic stress can contribute to fatigue and worsen health risks. Explore stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga.  Consider spending time in nature or engaging in hobbies you enjoy.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Schedule regular check-ups:**  Given your medium risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer, it's crucial to schedule regular check-ups with your doctor.  These check-ups will allow for early detection and management of any potential health issues.  Discuss your concerns about fatigue and your lifestyle changes with your physician.\n",
            "\n",

            "* **Consider a multivitamin:**  A multivitamin can help fill any nutritional gaps in your diet, particularly if you're struggling to eat healthily.  Discuss this with your doctor before starting any new supplements.\n",
